## Implementation

The parallel versions of this algorithm that have been implemented are:

1. The matrix is divided by chunks of continuous rows, each chunk is assigned to a worker.
2. Parallel implementation using FastFlow library.

A sequential version of the program has also been implemented to perform comparisons.

## Compiling

A Makefile was created to compile the various versions. To create the executable files, it is possible to execute the rule

```bash
    make
```

## Running

To run an experiment, it is possible to launch the program and pass the necessary arguments. An example is the following

```bash
    ./main.out [mode] [matrix_size] [number_iterations] [tolerance] [output_filename] [num_threads]
``` 

where
- **[mode]**: is the modality to execute the algorithm 
- - **[seq]**: sequential version
- - **[thr]**: native threads version
- - **[ff]**: FastFlow version
- **[matrix_size]**: is the length of the matrix and vector. A matrix of size matrix_size*matrix_size and a vector of length matrix_size will be created.
- **[number_iterations]**: Number of iterations to be performed for Jacobi's method.
- **[tolerance]**: is the stopping criteria in order to avoid to reach the maximum number of iterations.
- **[output_filename]: is the filename where the outputs will be saved (it is a csv file)
- **[num_threads]**: Degree of parallelism to be used.

To run all experiments at once run the file execute.sh

```bash
    ./bash.sh
``` 

## Results

Below are some results for completion time and speedup with matrixes of size $15.000 \times 15.000$
